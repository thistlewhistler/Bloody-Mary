So.
Intention of this is twofold.
•Produce a code with function to push notifications of a comic updating
  Either when the comic actually updates (ideal)
    or daily.
•Implement this code in Discord as a webhook
  Redirecting the expected result of changes to this repository instead to the webcomic.
.
That's the plan anyway.

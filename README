So.
Intention of this is twofold.
•Produce a code with function to push notifications of a comic updating
  Either when the comic actually updates (ideal)
    or daily.
•Implement this code in Discord as a webhook
  Redirecting the expected result of changes to this repository instead to the webcomic.
    So. How do I change what the webhook posts as a result? How might I get the webhook to push a file that I wrote in this github?
That's the plan anyway.

I feel like I may be going about this the wrong way. That a webhook is only able to push notifications of a change to github.
And I can't trick it into pushing notifications about something else.
.
So the quesiton becomes: How do I get something in Discord to push a notification about a website?
I need a device to push a payload from one place to another.
I am presuming if github is the brain, and a website update is the payload happening in a location, 
and Discord being another location,
The device would be either a webhook or something else to inform Discord that the brain detected a payload.
Am I describing a bot? Is that what I need?
